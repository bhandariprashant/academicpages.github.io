I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Dr. Tong Geon Lee’s Lab](https://tonggeonlee.org/) at the [Horticultural Sciences Department, University of Florida](https://hos.ifas.ufl.edu/).




I study the genetics of complex traits in plants. While my research overlaps with plant breeding, bioinformatics, genomics, statistics, and machine learning, at my core, I am training as an applied geneticist.






I am excited by the possibilities each fresh set of DNA sequences and phenotypes brings in answering research questions. I enjoy data wrangling, data analysis, and programming to make sense of high-dimensional data.





Next time you meet me, let’s talk about informatics or the [fantasy premier league](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) or your research.
