I am a third-year PhD student in Tong Geon Lee Lab at Horticultural Sciences department, University of Florida.
I study genetics of complex traits in plants. While my research overlaps with plant breeding, bioinformatics, genomics, statistics, and machine learning;
at my core I am training as an applied geneticist. I am excited by the possibilites each fresh-set of DNA sequences and phenotypes bring in answering research questions. I enjoy  data wrangling, data analysis, and programming to address the challenges brought in by high-dimensional data.




Next time you meet me, let's talk about tomato genomics or fantasy premier league (EPL) or your favorite stand up artist or your research.
