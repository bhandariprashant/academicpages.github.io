I am an interdisciplinary, process-oriented scientist with skills in bioinformatics, genomics, quantitative genetics, plant breeding, and plant sciences.


I am completing my Ph.D. with [Dr. Tong Geon Lee](https://tonggeonlee.org/) at the [University of Florida](https://hos.ifas.ufl.edu/). Here, I studied
recombination, association mapping, and genomic selection of complex traits like yield.

I am in the job market beginning 2023. I am looking for scientist/research positions where I want to contribute to the use of quantitative tools toward cultivar development.
