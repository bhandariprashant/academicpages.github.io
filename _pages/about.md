I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Dr. Tong Geon Lee’s Lab at the Horticultural Sciences Department, University of Florida.




I study the genetics of complex traits in plants. While my research overlaps with plant breeding, bioinformatics, genomics, statistics, and machine learning, at my core, I am training as an applied geneticist.






I am excited by the possibilities each fresh set of DNA sequences and phenotypes brings in answering research questions. I enjoy data wrangling, data analysis, and programming to address the challenges brought in by high-dimensional data.





Next time you meet me, let’s talk about the scientific method or the big Lebowski or genomics or fantasy premier league (EPL) or machine learning or the wire or reproducible research or your favorite standup artist or your research.
