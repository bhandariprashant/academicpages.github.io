I am an interdisciplinary, process-oriented scientist with skills in genomics, quantitative genetics, bioinformatics, plant breeding, and plant sciences.

I am working on the genetics of water use efficiency in Sorghum and Setaria as a postdoc in Dr. Ivan Baxter's lab. See the amazing work [Ivan's team](https://www.danforthcenter.org/our-work/principal-investigators/ivan-baxter/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwkqSlBhDaARIsAFJANkhq6SpcXllIvaw_tORPB9_XIauSG_NgZfgEOzsQH4bHbb9YgqYBqxwaAgJsEALw_wcB) is doing at the [Donald Danforth Plant Science Center](https://www.danforthcenter.org/) in St Louis, MO.
I completed my Ph.D. with [Dr. Tong Geon Lee](https://tonggeonlee.org/) at the [University of Florida](https://hos.ifas.ufl.edu/). There, I studied
recombination, association mapping, and genomic selection of complex traits like yield in fresh-market tomato.
