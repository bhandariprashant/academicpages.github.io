I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Dr. Tong Geon Lee’s Lab at the Horticultural Sciences Department, University of Florida.




I study the genetics of complex traits in plants. While my research overlaps with plant breeding, bioinformatics, genomics, statistics, and machine learning, at my core, I am training as an applied geneticist.






I am excited by the possibilities each fresh set of DNA sequences and phenotypes brings in answering research questions. I enjoy data wrangling, data analysis, and programming to make sense of high-dimensional data.





Next time you meet me, let’s talk about the scientific method or the big Lebowski or machine learning or fantasy premier league (EPL) or the wire or your research.
